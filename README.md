# GrandExchangeAI Setup Guide

Welcome to the GrandExchangeAI project! This guide will walk you through the steps needed to set up and run the GrandExchangeAI application on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website. This project was developed with Python 3.8, but it should be compatible with most Python 3.x versions.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Drlordbasil/GrandExchangeAI.git
   cd GrandExchangeAI
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage the project's dependencies independently. Run the following command to create a virtual environment named `venv`:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   Install the project dependencies using `pip`:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Setup the database:**
   Ensure the SQLite database (`osrs_data.db`) is located in the project's root directory or update the database path in the scripts accordingly.

## Running the Application

To run the GrandExchangeAI application, execute the main script from the command line:
```
python main.py
```
